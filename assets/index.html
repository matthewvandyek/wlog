                    Suceeded in finally setting up a server for this project. Maybe it's not the best and I didn't do that much research, but it was the easiest to do for now.
                    I looked into AWS but, in general, if you're having trouble getting things done, it's self sabotage to to do the things you want the way you want from the start.
                    A good compromise between working hard on the essentials and setting up something that you can build on as you go â€” or something like that.

                    The goal for this week is to setup Postgre and get further into the Rust course.
                    It's probably going to take me the rest of the summer to finish it, since after work I just don't have enough energy to study well.
                    But that's ok. I've been writing these during breaks (when people see an open editor, nobody suspects anything)

                    After an embarassing amount of months I've finally succeeded in getting myself to start on this project.
                    Hello, I'm Mave and this is just a silly blog. Eventually I'll set it up on a real server and use an actual frontend (maybe).

                    I just wanted to write some thoughts and impressions. I'm a programmer and fresh out of a computer engineering degree. Interested in too many things for my own good.
